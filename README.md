## Project Design and Implementation

### Overview
The game is built using object-oriented programming principles for maintainability and scalability.

### Key Classes and Concepts
- **`GameController`:**
  - Manages the game lifecycle, UI, scoring, and background elements.
- **`PlayerAirplane`:**
  - Handles player controls, movement, and shooting.
- **`EnemyAirplane`:**
  - Implements AI for patrolling and attacking behaviors.
- **`Bullet`:**
  - Manages player and enemy bullets, including movement and collision.
- **`Ball`:**
  - Base class for `Bullet` and `MysteryBall`, defining physics-based behavior.
- **`MysteryBall`:**
  - Spawns based on score milestones, providing power-ups.

### Power-ups and MysteryBalls
- MysteryBalls spawn randomly at score milestones.
- Grants temporary abilities such as:
  - **Health Boost:** Restores player health.
  - **Tri-Bullet:** Fires three bullets simultaneously.
    
---

## Key Functionalities
- Smooth player movement and shooting using key events.
- Collision detection for bullets, enemies, and power-ups.
- AI-driven enemy behavior with attack and patrol states.
- Randomly spawned power-ups managed via timers.

---

## Testing
- **Collision Handling:** Tested for accuracy with enemies and power-ups.
- **Power-up Activation:** Verified correct activation and deactivation timing.
- **Game State Transitions:** Ensured smooth transitions between login, gameplay, and game-over states.
- **Performance:** Optimized for smooth gameplay even with high object counts.

### Known Bugs
- Occasional overlapping of enemy spawns.
- Rare delays in power-up deactivation due to frame timing.

---

## Project Sophistication Level
- **Rating:** 90/100
- Includes dynamic AI interactions, engaging mechanics like tri-directional shooting, and state-driven enemy behavior.
